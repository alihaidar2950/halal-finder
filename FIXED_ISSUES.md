# Fixed Issues in Halal Finder App

## 1. Missing Restaurants Page
- Created a new `/restaurants` page at `src/app/restaurants/page.tsx`
- Implemented functionality to display restaurants in a list with filtering options

## 2. API Route Issues

### Fixed the Restaurant ID API Route
- Updated the `/api/restaurants/[id]/route.ts` file to properly handle params
- Changed the type of request parameter to `NextRequest` for better compatibility
- Safely extracted the ID from params without using String() on potentially async params

### Fixed localStorage Usage in Server Components
- Added an `isLocalStorageAvailable` function to `src/utils/cacheUtils.ts` to check if localStorage is available
- Added checks before using localStorage in all cache utility functions
- This prevents the "localStorage is not defined" error in server-side code

### Fixed URL Construction in Fetch Requests
- Updated `fetchRestaurantDetails` function in `src/services/restaurantService.ts` to use absolute URLs
- Added a check for browser environment and constructs the proper URL with `window.location.origin`
- Added a fallback for server-side execution to prevent errors

## 3. Favorites Functionality Issues

### Improved the Favorites API Endpoint
- Enhanced the `/api/restaurants/favorites/route.ts` endpoint with better error handling and logging
- Added detailed console logs to track the API requests and responses
- Improved error messages to help diagnose issues

### Fixed the Restaurant Details Fetching
- Updated `fetchRestaurantDetails` in `src/services/restaurantService.ts` with more robust error handling
- Added validation for empty restaurant IDs and missing data in API responses
- Improved caching mechanism to correctly store and retrieve restaurant details

### Enhanced the Favorites Page
- Added better error state handling to show users when something goes wrong
- Improved the loading state to provide better feedback while favorites are being loaded
- Added toast notifications to inform users about missing restaurants
- Updated the UI to match the app's color scheme (yellow/gold accents)

### Fixed Server-Side Restaurant Fetching
- Completely rewrote the favorites API to fetch restaurant details directly using the Google Places API
- Eliminated the "Cannot fetch restaurant details in server context" error by avoiding client-side functions in server components
- Restaurant details are now properly fetched and returned in the API response

### Optimized Favorites Storage (Option 1)
- Modified the database schema to store full restaurant details in the favorites table
- Updated the FavoriteButton component to save restaurant details when adding to favorites
- Modified the favorites page to use the stored details directly from the database
- Added backward compatibility for legacy favorites that only have the restaurant ID
- Significantly improved performance by reducing API calls to Google Places API
- Enhanced user experience by making favorites page load faster

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**: 
   - Verify that clicking on the RESTAURANTS link now works correctly
   - Test the favorites functionality to ensure it's working properly
   - Monitor the console for any remaining errors

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - The updated caching system now gracefully falls back when localStorage is not available
   - Server-side rendering and client-side components are properly separated
   - Reduced API calls through proper data storage in the database

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added more robust error handling throughout the application
   - Improved user feedback when errors occur
