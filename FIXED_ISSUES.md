# Fixed Issues in Halal Finder App

## 1. Missing Restaurants Page
- Created a new `/restaurants` page at `src/app/restaurants/page.tsx`
- Implemented functionality to display restaurants in a list with filtering options

## 2. API Route Issues

### Fixed the Restaurant ID API Route
- Updated the `/api/restaurants/[id]/route.ts` file to properly handle params
- Changed the type of request parameter to `NextRequest` for better compatibility
- Safely extracted the ID from params without using String() on potentially async params

### Fixed localStorage Usage in Server Components
- Added an `isLocalStorageAvailable` function to `src/utils/cacheUtils.ts` to check if localStorage is available
- Added checks before using localStorage in all cache utility functions
- This prevents the "localStorage is not defined" error in server-side code

### Fixed URL Construction in Fetch Requests
- Updated `fetchRestaurantDetails` function in `src/services/restaurantService.ts` to use absolute URLs
- Added a check for browser environment and constructs the proper URL with `window.location.origin`
- Added a fallback for server-side execution to prevent errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**: 
   - Verify that clicking on the RESTAURANTS link now works correctly
   - Test the favorites functionality to ensure it's working properly
   - Monitor the console for any remaining errors

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - The updated caching system now gracefully falls back when localStorage is not available
   - Server-side rendering and client-side components are properly separated

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added more robust error handling throughout the application
   - Improved user feedback when errors occur
