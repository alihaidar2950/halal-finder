# Favorites Authentication UX Improvements

## Implemented Features

### 1. Toast Notification with Sign In Prompt
- Added a clear toast notification when an unauthenticated user attempts to favorite a restaurant
- Includes a direct "Sign in" action button that opens the auth modal
- Provides contextual explanation that authentication is required for favorites

### 2. Auth Modal Implementation
- Created a reusable `AuthModal` component that can be used across the application
- Provides both sign-in and sign-up options in a single modal
- Preserves the current page URL as the redirect destination after authentication
- Styled to match the app's existing design system

### 3. Google Sign-In Option
- Added Google sign-in as an alternative authentication method
- Created SVG asset for the Google logo

### 4. UX Flow
- User clicks heart icon to favorite a restaurant
- If not signed in, receives toast notification explaining the requirement
- Auth modal appears, offering sign-in/sign-up options
- After authentication, user is returned to the same page
- Favorites functionality works immediately after sign-in

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Friction**: Users understand why they're being asked to sign in
2. **Context Preservation**: Modal approach keeps users on the current page
3. **Multiple Options**: Users can choose between email or social sign-in
4. **Clear UX**: Visual feedback through toast notifications and modal design
5. **Seamless Experience**: Smooth transition from browsing to authentication

## Future Improvements

1. **Remember Intent**: After sign-in, automatically favorite the restaurant the user tried to save
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start collecting anonymous favorites in local storage that can be synced after sign-up
3. **Quick Return**: Implement a lightweight authentication that minimizes the steps required
4. **Auth State Persistence**: Ensure long-lived sessions to reduce re-authentication frequency
5. **Social Login Expansion**: Add more social login options (Facebook, Apple, etc.)
