## What is Halal Finder?

Halal Finder is a modern web application designed to solve a common challenge for Muslim communities worldwide: finding restaurants that serve halal food. Using location-based technology and data from Google Maps, Halal Finder makes it easy to discover, explore, and get directions to halal dining options near you.

## The Problem We're Solving

For Muslims who follow halal dietary guidelines, finding suitable dining options can be challenging, especially when:
- Traveling to unfamiliar areas
- Living in regions where halal options are limited
- Wanting to verify the authenticity of halal claims
- Needing to know if a restaurant is fully halal or just offers halal options

## How Halal Finder Works

1. **Locate You**: The app uses your device's geolocation to find your position (with your permission)
2. **Find Nearby Restaurants**: We search for restaurants within your chosen radius 
3. **Analyze Halal Status**: Our custom algorithm analyzes restaurant data to classify halal status
4. **Present Options**: Results are displayed in an easy-to-browse format with all the information you need
5. **Get You There**: Integrated directions via Google Maps help you navigate to your chosen restaurant

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Location-Based Search**: Find halal restaurants near your current location
- **Custom Search**: Look for specific cuisines or restaurant names
- **Intelligent Filters**: Narrow results by distance and cuisine type
- **Detailed Restaurant Profiles**: View photos, opening hours, contact information, and more

### Halal Status Classification
Our application automatically classifies restaurants into three halal categories:

- üü¢ **Fully Halal**: Completely halal restaurants, often certified
- üü° **Halal Options**: Restaurants that offer halal menu items but may serve non-halal food
- üü† **Halal Ingredients**: Establishments that use halal ingredients or can prepare halal food on request

Each classification includes a confidence rating based on our analysis of available information.

### User Experience Features

- **Smart Caching**: Fast performance with reduced API calls
